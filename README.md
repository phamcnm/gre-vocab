# GRE Vocabulary

This is my record and personal GRE vocabulary trainer. It stores all the words I see in practice questions, and quiz me to help me remember them. Follow this to learn GRE vocab together with me.

## Overview

The program words.py is a record on what new words I see each day, which I will update daily or almost daily. I will put in the words, their definitions, and example sentences. 

The program quiz.py will help me learn them. There is an option to test on new words on that day, an option to test on new words in recent days, and an option to scramble every words together.

There are different type of quizzes. So far, we have:

	def-to-word
	fill-in-the-blank

## Definition to Word

Each question gives you a definition, and you have to give the word that fits that defintion.

#### How to use

To run type in:

	python3 def-to-word.py

In the quiz, there are useful functions:

	-c for choices, to show word choices for that specific question, randomly mixed with the right word.
	-h for hints, to show example sentence with the quizzed word blanked out.

## Fill in the blank

Each question gives you a sentence with a blank, and you have to choose a word that completes the sentence.

#### How to use

To run type in:

	python3 fill-in-the-blank.py

In the quiz, there are useful functions:

	-d for definition, to show the definition of the word that would complete the sentence.

## Credits

All code is written by myself. Words are seen in practice questions. Definitions of words are mostly taken online. Examples are either taken online or come up by myself.
