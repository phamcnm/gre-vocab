# GRE Vocabulary

This is my record and personal GRE vocabulary trainer. It stores all the words I see in practice questions, and quiz me to help me remember them. Follow this to learn GRE vocab together with me.

## How to use

The program words.py is a record on what new words I see each day, which I will update daily or almost. I will put in the words, their definitions, and example sentences.

The program quiz.py will help me learn them. There is an option to test on new words on that day, an option to test on new words in recent days, and an option to scramble every words together. In the quiz, there are useful functions.

	-c for choices, to show word choices for that specific question, randomly mixed with the right word.
	-h for hints, to show example sentence with the quizzed word blanked out.

## How to run

	python3 quiz.py

## Credits
